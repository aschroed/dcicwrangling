!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Hybrid mouse ES cells  F121-6,were grown on mitomycin-C-inactivated MEFs in ES media: DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum (Seralab, seralab EU-000-F), 200mM L-glutamine (Gibco, life technologies 25030-024), 50mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, life technologies 31380-010), penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, life technologies 15140-122), 5ml non-essential amino acids (Gibco, life technologies 11140-035) and 10^3 U/mL LIF.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genome-wide ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing) libraries were generated as previously described (Buenrostro et al. 2013). Briefly, nuclei from 200,000 cells were treated with transposase (Illumina) and DNA purified on a MinElute column (Qiagen), libraries were amplified using Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit and  purified twice with PCR clean-up kit columns (Qiagen).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Libraries were sequenced (100 bp paired-end) on the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina).
