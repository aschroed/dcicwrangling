!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = NG Capture-C libraries were prepared as described in Davies et al. 2016 (doi:10.1038/nmeth.3664) using a pool of 63 oligos targeting 37 capture regions.
!Sample_description = Sample 1
!Sample_data_processing = Sample demultiplexing and FastQ file generation was performed using Illumina Conversion Software bcl2fastq v.2.18.
!Sample_data_processing = The raw data were processed following the standard workflow described in Davies et al. 2016 (doi:10.1038/nmeth.3664 and https://github.com/telenius/captureC/releases) in the following steps:
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality assessment with FastQC v.0.11.5 followed by adaptor trimming using Trim Galore v.0.4.1 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/) with parameters: --stringency 3 --paired
!Sample_data_processing = Merging the paired-end reads into fragments using FLASH v.1.2.11 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/flashpage) with parameters: --interleaved-output -m 10 -M 150 -x 0.1 -t 1 -z
!Sample_data_processing = In silico DpnII restriction digest of the merged reads using the custom script dpnII2E.pl (https://github.com/telenius/captureC/releases)
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment of the digested reads to the mm9 genome with Bowtie v.1.1.2 (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) with parameters: -p 1 -m 2 -y --best --strata --chunkmbs 1024
!Sample_data_processing = Mapped data filtering, visualisation and interaction quantitation using the custom script CCanalyser3.pl (https://github.com/telenius/captureC/releases) with default parameters
!Sample_data_processing = Genome_build: NCBIM37 (mm9)
!Sample_data_processing = Supplementary_files_format_and_content: tarball containing 37 .gff files with Capture-C interaction counts, 37 smoothed .wig coverage files for browser visualisation and a .txt annotation file for the 37 captured genomic regions
