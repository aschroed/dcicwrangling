!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = 10nM ds siRNA  (Prep1 and Luc) were transfected using RNAi Max lipofectamine. Cells were FACS-sorted in six sub-phases of the S phase (S1-S6) according to increasing DNA content.

!Sample_data_processing = Library strategy: Repli-Seq
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned to the hg19 genome using Bowtie v.0.12.8 (3)
!Sample_data_processing = Duplicate reads were removed using Samtool rmdup v 0.1.18
!Sample_data_processing = The reference genome was binned in 100bp intervals, and the signal from the sequencing data underlying these regions was calculated
!Sample_data_processing = TMM (trimmed mean of M values) normalization from the edgeR was applied to the six S-phase cells subpopulations, and for each genomic 100bp interval, the signal was scaled in values ranging from 0 to 1 among all S-phase fractions
!Sample_data_processing = Scaled signals were subtracted from an accordingly scaled signal derived from sequencing data from unsorted siPREP1 and siLUC cells
!Sample_data_processing = Negative values where converted to zero values and a quantile normalizazion was applied between the same data from S1-S6 sub-populations of cells.
!Sample_data_processing = Human genome was divided in 50-Kb intervals and S50 value was measured for each of them. S50 is a replication timing estimator that measures the fraction of the S phase at which 50% of a given genomic region has been replicated; it ranges from zero to 1
