!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Cells are grown under standard tissue culture conditions (10 - 15% FBS, 5% CO2, DMEM or RPMI media, and 1X Pen-Strep) as the Coriell culture practices demand)

!Sample_data_processing = Library strategy: Hi-C-seq
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were mapped to a combined Burrows-Wheeler reference of hg19 and mm10 using bowtie2. They were then filtered using custom Python scripts to generate validPairs files (see README file on series record).
