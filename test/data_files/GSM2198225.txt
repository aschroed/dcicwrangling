!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Except where indicated in the text as uninduced, we induced cells to mature with 100nM estradiol to activate GATA1-ER. During estradiol induction, we simultaneously treated cells with nocodazole (200ng/ml) for 7h-13h, washed once, and replated into fresh medium lacking nocodazole for varying times (40min-360min), ensuring all samples are exposed to estradiol for the same duration of 13h. We fixed cells with 1% formaldehyde, stained with DAPI, and sorted on a BD FACSAria based on YFP-MD and DAPI signal.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = G1E erythroblasts were previously derived through deletion of GATA1 in mouse embryonic stem cells, followed by in vitro differentiation (Weiss, Yu, and Orkin 1997). We cultured a sub-line of G1E cells, G1E-ER4, in which GATA1-ER was retrovirally transduced (referred to in main text as â€œG1E GATA1-ER"), as previously described (Weiss, Yu, and Orkin 1997). We retrovirally transduced G1E-ER4 cells with the YFP-MD construct (Kadauke et al. 2012) and sorted for a pool of YFP-positive cells.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = After cell fixation with 1% formaldehyde for 10min and cell sorting as described above, Capture-C was performed with a double-capture procedure (Davies et al. 2016). Chromatin was digested using DpnII. We used biotin labelled DNA oligos to pull down the target restriction fragments.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Capture-C libraries were sequenced on Nextseq500 with 2x75 bp paired end sequencing.

!Sample_data_processing = The raw reads were processed using published scripts (https://github.com/telenius/captureC/releases).
!Sample_data_processing = Custom scripts in R to normalize data by the total number of reads representing fragments ligated to the anchor region in the library.
!Sample_data_processing = For each time point and anchor, used custom scripts in R to combine reads representing fragments ligated to the anchor region in the library into one .bedgraph file merged across restriction digestion and/or capture replicates.
